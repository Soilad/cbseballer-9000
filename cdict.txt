Br2, however, oxidises F to I2 but not F–\xa0\xa0to F2 , and Cl–\xa0\xa0  to Cl2.\nF2(g) + 2Cr(aq) ———–> 2F–(aq) + Cl2(g); F2(g) + 2Br–(aq) ———-> 2F–(aq) + Br2 (Z)\nF2(g) + 2I–(aq) ———-> 2F–(aq) + I2(s); Cl2 (g) + 2Br–(aq) ————> 2Cl–(aq) + Br2 (Z)\nCl2(g) + 2I–(aq) ———–> 2Cl–\xa0\xa0(aq) + I2(s) and Br2 (Z) + 2F ———> 2Br– (aq) + I2(s)\nThus, F2 is the best oxidant.\nConversely, halide ions have a tendency to lose electrons and hence can act as reducing agents. Since the electrode potentials of halide ions decreases in the order: I–(-0.54 V) > Br– (-1.09 V) > Cl–(-1.36 V) > I2\xa0(-2.87 V), therefore, the reducing power of the halide ions or their corresponding hydrohalic acids decreases in the same order: HI > HBr > HCl > HF. Thus, hydroiodic acid is the best reductant. This is supported by the following reactions. For example, HI and HBr reduce\xa0H2S04\xa0to S02\xa0while HCl and HF do not.\n2HBr + H2S04 —–> Br2+ S02 + 2H2O; 2HI + H2S04 ——> I2 + S02 + 2H2O\nFurther F reduces Cu2+ to Cu+ but Br does not.\n2Cu2+(aq) + 4I–(aq) >Cu2I2(s) + I2(aq); Cu2+(aq) + 2Br–> No reaction.\nThus, HI is a stronger reductant than HBr.\nFurther among HCl and HF, HCl is a stronger reducing agent than HF because HCl reduces MnO2 to\xa0Mn2+ but HF does not.\nMnO2 (s) + 4HCl(aq) ——-> MnCl2(aq) + Cl2(aq) + 2H2O\nMnO2 (s) + 4HF(l) ———–> No reaction.\nThus, the reducing character of hydrohalic acids decreases in the order: HI > HBr > HCl > HF.', 'Question 16.

The impure liquid is boiled in a flask and the vapours so formed are collected and condensed to give back pure liquid in another vessel. Simple organic liquids such as benzene toluene, xylene etc. can be purified.\n(c) Chromatography: Chromatography is based on the principle of selective distribution of the components of a mixture between two phases, a stationary phase and a moving phase. The stationary phase can be a solid or liquid, while the moving phase is a liquid or a gas. When the stationary phase is solid the basis is adsorption and when it is a liquid the basis is partition.

So, pressure also does not reduce linearly with height. The air pressure at a height h is given by P = P0e–αh where P0 represents the pressure of air at sea-level and α is a constant.\n(c) Due to applied force on liquid, the pressure is transmitted equally in all directions inside the liquid.

If TSL,and TSA be the surface tensions corresponding to solid-liquid layer, liquid-air layer and solid-air layer respectively and θ be the angle of contact between the liquid and solid, then\n\nTLA Cos θ + TSL =TSA\n=>Cos θ=TSA-TSL/TLA\nFor the mercury-glass interface, TSA< TSL. Therefore, cos 0 is negative. Thus θ is an obtuse angle. For the water-glass interface, TSA > TSL. Therefore cos 0 is positive. Thus, θ is an acute angle.\n(b) Water on a clean glass surface tends to spread out i.e., water wets glass because force of cohesion of water is much less than the force of adhesion due to glass. In case of mercury force of cohesion due to mercury molecules is quite strong as compared to adhesion force due to glass. Consequently, mercury does not wet glass and tends to form drops.\n(c) Surface tension of liquid is the force acting per unit length on a line drawn tangentially to the liquid surface at rest. Since h as force is independent of the area of liquid surface therefore, surface tension is also independent of the area of the liquid surface.\n(d) We know that the clothes have narrow pores or spaces which act as capillaries. Also, we know that the rise of liquid in a capillary tube is directly proportional to cosθ (Here θ is the angle of contact). As θ is small for detergent, therefore cos θ will be large. Due to this, the detergent will penetrate more in the narrow pores of the clothes.\n(e) We know that any system tends to remain in a state of minimum energy.

As a result, the pressure on it decreases in accordance with the Bernoulli’s theorem whereas the pressure below remains the same (atmospheric pressure). Thus, the paper remains horizontal.\n(b) By doing so the area of outlet of water jet is reduced, so velocity of water increases according to equation of continuity av = constant.\n(c) For a constant height, Bernoulli’s theorem is expressed as P +1/2 ρ v2\xa0= Constant\nIn this equation, the pressure P occurs with a single power whereas the velocity occurs with a square power. Therefore, the velocity has more effect compared to the pressure. It is for this reason that needle of the syringe controls flow rate better than the thumb pressure exerted by the doctor.\n(d) This is because of principle of conservation of momentum. While the flowing fluid carries forward momentum, the vessel gets a backward momentum.\n(e) A spinning cricket ball would have followed a parabolic trajectory has there been no air.

A mono atomic gas molecule has only the translational motion. A diatomic gas molecule, apart from translational motion, the vibrational as well as rotational motion is also possible. Therefore, to raise the temperature of 1 mole of a diatomic gas through 1°C, heat is to be supplied to increase not only translational energy but also rotational and vibrational energies. Hence, molar specific heat of a diatomic gas is greater than that for mono atomic gas. The higher value of molar specific heat of chlorine as compared to hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen etc. shows that for chlorine molecule, at room temperature vibrational motion also occurs along with translational and rotational motions, whereas other diatomic molecules at room temperature usually have rotational motion apart from their translational motion.

However, when the wooden tray is touched, heat does not flow from our hands to the tray and we do not feel cold.\n(c) An optical pyrometer is based on the principle that the brightness of a glowing surface of a body depends upon its temperature. Therefore, if the temperature of the body is less than 600°C, the image formed by the optical pyrometer is not brilliant and we do not get the reliable result. It is for this reason that the pyrometer gives a very low value for the temperature of red hot iron in the open.\n(d) The lower layers of earth’s atmosphere reflect infrared radiations from earth back to the surface of earth.

Why?\n': 'wer:\nYes, it can be said to be in equilibrium when it moves with uniform velocity as no acceleration i.e. no net force acts on the body.', 'Question 47.\n(a) A thief jumps from the upper story of a house with a load on his back. What is the force of the load on his back when the thief is in the air?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the thief is in the air, he is in the state of free fall, and hence in the state of weightlessness. So the force of the load on his back is zero.', 'Question 48.\nWhat are the different effects a force is capable of producing?\n': 'wer:\nForce can cause the following', 'Question 49.\nA ball is thrown up at a speed of 36 ms-1 by a thrower. If the ball returns to the thrower with the same speed. Will, there be any change in:\n(a) Momentum of the ball?\n': 'wer:\nThere will be a change in the direction of the momentum of the ball.', 'Question 50.\nWhen a ball falls from a height its momentum increases. What causes the increase in the momentum of the ball?\n': 'wer:\nThe gravitational force acting in the direction of motion increases the velocity and hence momentum of the ball.', 'Question 51.\nWhen a high jumper leaves the ground, where does the force which accelerates the jumper upward comes from?\n': 'wer:\nThe high jumper after taking a short run presses the ground hard, the ground, in turn, reacts on him and provides the necessary upward accelerating force to the jumper. Thus, the reaction of the ground on the jumper is the required force.', 'Question 52.\nName the forces which are in equilibrium in each of the following situations:\n(a) a book resting on a table.\n': 'wer:\nThe gravitational force on the book and a force of reaction of the table.', 'Question 1.\n(a) A learner shooter fired a shot from his rifle and his shoulder got injured ¡n the process. What mistake did he commit?\n': 'wer:\nWe know that a gun recoils i.e. moves back after firing. To avoid injury to the shoulder, the gun must he held tightly against the shoulder. The learner shooter might have not held it tightly against his shoulder and hence the gun must have injured his shoulder after firing.', 'Question 2.\n(a) Newton’s first law of motion is the law of Inertia. Explain.\n': 'wer:\nAccording to Newton’s first law of motion, a body can’t change its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless an external force acts on it. It means that the natural tendency of the material body is to continue in the state of rest or that of uniform motion which is termed as inertia. Thus Newton’s first law is the law of inertia.', 'Question 3.\n(a) An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter-steller space at a constant rate of 100 ms-2. What is the acceleration of the astronaut at the instant after he is outside the spaceship?\n': 'wer:\nAccording to Newton’s first law of motion, the moment he is out of the spaceship, there is no external force on the astronaut, thus his acceleration is zero. Here we are assuming that he is out of the gravitational field of heavenly bodies i.e. there are no nearby stars to exert a gravitational force on him and the small spaceship exerts a negligible gravitational attraction on him.', 'Question 4.\n(a) When a man jumps out of a boat, then it is pushed away. Why?\n': 'wer:\nThis is due to Newton’s third law of motion. When the man jumps out of the boat, he applies a force on it in the backward direction, and in turn, the reaction of the boat on the man pushes him out of the boat.', 'Question 5.\nTwo hoys on ice-skates hold a rope between them. One boy is much heavier than the other. The lightweight boy pulls on the rope. How will they move?\n': 'wer:\nThe light-weight boy is doing the action on the heavy boy by pulling the rope. According to Newton’s third law, equal and opposite force (reaction) also acts on the light boy. As the mass of the boy pulling the rope is lesser, so the acceleration produced in him will be more. Thus both the boys move tow; rds each other and the lighter boy will move faster.', 'Question 6.\nExplain why ball bearings are used in machinery?\n': 'wer:\nWe know that rolling friction is much lesser than sliding friction, so we convert the sliding friction into rolling friction which is done using ball bearings that are placed in between the axle and the hub of the wheel. The ball bearings tend to roll around the axle as the wheel turns and as such the frictional force is reduced.', 'Question 7.\nWhy a horse has to apply more force to start a cart than to keep it moving? Explain.\n': 'wer:\nStatic friction comes into play when the horse applies force to start the motion in the cart. On the other hand, kinetic friction comes into play when the cart is moving.', 'Question 8.\nSand is thrown on tracks or roads covered with snow. Explain why?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the roads (or tracks) are covered with snow, then there is a considerable reduction of frictional force between the tires of the vehicles and the road (or between the track and the wheels of the vehicle or train) which leads to the skidding of the vehicles (or trains). Thus, driving is not safe. When sand is thrown on the snow-covered roads (or tracks), then the force of friction increases, so safe driving is possible.', 'Question 9.\nExplain why is it difficult to move a cycle along a road with its brakes on?\n': 'wer:\nWhen we move the cycle with its brakes on, then its wheels can only skid i.e. slide along the road as they can’t rotate. So the friction is sliding in nature. As the sliding friction is greater than fr,e rolling friction, therefore, it is difficult to move a cycle with its brakes on.', 'Question 10.\nExplain how proper inflation of tires saves fuel?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the tires are properly inflated, the area of contact between the tires and the ground is reduced which in turn reduces the rolling friction. As a result of this, there is less dissipation of energy against friction. So the cover of the automobile/eater distance for the same quantity of fuel consumed. Hence proper inflation of tires leads to saving fuel.', 'Question 11.\nExplain how the man at rest in the middle of a pond of perfectly frictionless ice comes out by blowing air or splitting etc.?\n': 'wer:\nBy blowing air from b’s mouth in a forwarding direction, the man applies some force in that direction and hence imparts some momentum to the air blown out from his mouth. According to the law of conservation of linear momentum, an equal and opposite momentum will be imparted to his body. Since there is no force of friction and hence no energy is wasted. Finally, by doing the same action again and again he gets himself on the shore.', 'Question 12.\nGive one argument in favor of the fact that frictional force is a non-conservative force.\n': 'wer:\nThe direction of the frictional force is opposite to the direction of motion. When a body is moved, say from point A to B and then back to A, then work is required to be done both during forward and backward motion. So the network done in a round trip is not zero. Hence the frictional force is a non-conservative force.', 'Question 13.\nWhy is it more dangerous to fall on frozen ice than on fresh snow?\n': 'wer:\nThe fresh snow is softer and frozen ice is harder. So the impulse caused by falling on fresh snow is much lesser than frozen snow. Thus, falling on frozen ice may cause serious injury or maybe fatal (the reaction will be much greater in this case).', 'Question 14.\n(a) An astronaut in open space is away from his spaceship. How can he return to his ship?\n': 'wer:\nUsing Newton’s third law of motion, he can reach his spaceship. He must throw objects with appropriate force opposite to the direction of the spaceship. The recoil will send him-to his spaceship.', 'Question 15.\nWhat is the difference between absolute and gravitational units of force?\n': 'wer:\nThe absolute units of force don’t depend upon the value of acceleration due to gravity, so they remain the same throughout the universe. But the gravitational units of force depend upon the value of ‘g’ which is different at different places.', 'Question 16.\nA disc of mass m is placed on a table. A stiff spring is attached to it and is vertical. To the other end of the spring is attached a disc of negligible mass. What minimum force should be applied to the upper disc to press the spring such that the lower disc is lifted off the table when the external force is suddenly removed?\n': 'wer:\nThe minimum force should be mg. When a force mg is applied vertically downwards on the upper disc, the lower disc will be pressed against the floor with a force mg. The floor will exert an upward reaction mg. When the external force is suddenly removed, this reaction will just lift the lower disc.', 'Question 17.\nA force acting on a material particle of mass m first grows to a maximum value Fm and then decreases to zero. The force varies with time according to a linear law, and the total time of motion is tm. What will be the velocity of the particle at the end of this time interval if the initial velocity is zero?\n': 'wer:\nIn the given problem,\n\n= area under F – t graph\n= area of ΔOAB ..(1)\nfrau\n|\n\x0c\nhttps://www.learninsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Class-11-Physics-Important-Questions-Chapter-5-Laws-of-Motion-2.png', 'Question 18.\nSometimes we need to increase friction. Why? Given an example.\n': 'wer:\nSometimes friction between two surfaces decreases to such an extent that it is difficult to move on that surface. So friction needs to be increased. For example, vehicles can’t move on a road covered with snow. In such cases, we have to throw sand on the road to increase the friction.', 'Question 19.\nVehicles stop applying brakes. Does this phenomenon violate the principle of conservation of momentum?\n': 'wer:\nThe law of conservation of momentum is not violated by stopping vehicles from applying brakes. Some retarding force is being applied due to brakes and the vehicle comes to rest such that the total loss of its momentum is equal to the impulse of the applied force. Thus the law of conservation of momentum is not violated.', 'Question 20.\n“Two surfaces if made extremely smooth, will have a very low value of friction between them.” Is the statement true? Justify your answer with two illustrations.\n': 'wer:\nThe given statement is wrong. This is because the force of frictions increased when the surfaces in contact are made highly smooth.', 'Question 21.\nWhy force of friction increases when the two surfaces in contact are made extremely smooth i.e. polished beyond a certain limit?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the two surfaces in contact are made extremely smooth, then they come in intimate contact with each other. So the force of adhesion comes into play- Due to this force, the motion of one surface over the other surface becomes retarding and hence causes an increase in the friction.', 'Question 22.\n(a) A small amount of water spread on a marble floor causes slipping. Why?\n': 'wer:\nWater fills the grooves in the floor and makes it more smooth thus reducing friction and it causes slipping.', 'Question 23.\nA body moving over the surface of another body suddenly comes to rest. What happens to friction between the two surfaces?\n': 'wer:\nThe force of friction will be present only so long as there is relative motion between the two bodies and it automatically disappears as soon as the relative motion ceases.', 'Question 24.\nExplain why one should take short steps rather than long steps while walking on ice?\n': 'wer:\nThere is a danger of slipping if one walks on ice by taking long steps. This can be explained as –', 'Question 25.\nWhy a cricket player lowers his hands while catching a cricket ball?\n': 'wer:\nWhile taking a catch, a cricket player moves his hands backward. He has to apply retarding force to stop the moving ball in his hands. If he catches the ball abruptly, then he has to apply a large retarding force for a short time. So he gets hurt.', 'Question 26.\nWhy are buffers provided between the bogies of a railway train?\n': 'wer:\nBuffers are provided between the bogies of a train to reduce shocks or jerks by reducing the impulse or impact of a force. Springs of buffers increase the time of contact in the collision of bogies and thus the force acting on the bogies will be small and hence the passengers sitting inside the train will feel fewer jerks.', 'Question 27.\nIt is more difficult to catch a cricket ball than to catch a tennis ball moving with the same velocity. Explain why?\n': 'wer:\nThe mass of a cricket ball is greater than the mass of a tennis ball, so the change in momentum of the cricket ball is more than that of the tennis ball. Hence greater force is required to catch the cricket ball than that of the tennis ball.', 'Question 28.\n(a) A body of mass 25 g is moving with a constant velocity of 5 ms’1 on a horizontal frictionless surface in a vacuum, what is the force acting on the body?\n': 'wer:\nF = ma, where a = acceleration of the body.\nFor constant velocity, a = 0, so F = 0.\nThus when a body moves with constant velocity then no force acts on it.', 'Question 29.\nA woman stands on a spring scale on an elevator. In which case will the scale record the minimum reading and the maximum reading?\n(i) elevator stationery,\n': 'wer:\nWhen the elevator is stationary, then reading of the scale = actual weight of woman = mg.', 'Question 30.\nTwo bodies of different masses m1 and m2 are falling from the same height. If resistance offered by the air be the same for both the bodies, then will they reach the Earth simultaneously? Assume m1 > m2?\n': 'wer:\nLet f be the resistance offered by the air for both the bodies.\nIf F = Net force acting on the body of mass m, i.e. weight W1 = m1g,\n\nThen F = W1 – f\n= m1g – f …(1)\n\x0c\nhttps://www.learninsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Class-11-Physics-Important-Questions-Chapter-5-Laws-of-Motion-8.png', 'Question 31.\nHow does air friction affect the maximum height of a projectile?\n': 'wer:\nThe air friction reduces both vertical and horizontal components of velocity. The air friction depends on the volume of the body or the air displaced. So the height attained by the body in projectile motion is severely restricted by the air friction. The height reached is reduced compared to one which is attained in the absence of air.', 'Question 32.\nWhy is it difficult to climb a greasy pole or rope?\n': 'wer:\nFor climbing any pole or rope, the climber presses the pole or rope with his feet which in turn pushes the feet and the person climbs up. But the man’s feet push the pole only if there is friction between the pole and the feet so that feet can hold on.', 'Question 33.\nDoes F = ma represent Newton’s second law of motion under all conditions? Give a reason for your answer.\n': 'wer:\nNo, F = ma does not represent Newton’s second law of motion under all conditions. In fact the statement of Newton’s second law of motion relates force with a change in momentum of the body i. e.\n\nIn a reference frame where the velocity of the body is too high i.e., it approaches the speed of light then mass does not remain the same.

How will you justify the statement?\n': 'wer:\nThere are three reasons for such situations to be dangerous –', 'Question 35.\nIn a circus in the game of swing, the man falls on a net after leaving the swing but he is not injured, why?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the man falls on the net it is depressed where a man falls on it and thus the time of contact is increased. Due to this, the force of reaction on the man is reduced to a great extent. Because the increase in time reduces the impulse which is equal to the changes in momentum (FΔt = m Δv). So, F is quite less and the man is not injured by the net. In fact, F pushes him up once and again he falls on the net.', 'Question 36.\n(a) A meteorite burns in the atmosphere before it reaches the Earth’s surface. What happens to its momentum?\n': 'wer:\nA meteorite while traveling towards earth shares its momentum with atmospheric particles and the remaining momentum is imparted to the Earth.', 'Question 37.\nIn pushing a box up an inclined plane, is it better to push horizontally or to push parallel to the inclined plane? Why?\n': 'wer:\nThe box should be pushed by a force parallel to the plane. This will neither increase the reaction nor the force of friction. If the force is applied horizontally, only a component of the force will push the box up but the second component acting normally to the inclined plane will increase the reaction of the plane and thereby increase the force of friction. This will make the pushing of the box up the inclined harder.', 'Question 38.\nExplain the role of friction in the case of bicycle brakes. What will happen if a few drops of oil are put on the rim?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the brakes are applied, the rubber padding creates', 'Question 39.\nA man cannot run faster on the sandy ground but a snake can. Why?\n': 'wer:\nThe greater friction of sandy ground stops the man from running faster but the snake gets support as its points of contact with the ground help in holding and pushing its body. The normal reaction of man is much more as compared to that of snake, that too is a factor in the relative force of friction acting on the two.', 'Question 1.\n(a) State and prove impulse-momentum Theorem.\n': 'wer:\nIt states that the impulse of force on a body is equal to the change in momentum of the body.\ni.e. J = Ft = P2 – P1', 'Question 2.\nDerive the general expression for the velocity of a rocket in flight and obtain the expression for the thrust acting on it.\n': 'wer:\nThe working of a rocket is based upon the principle of conservation of momentum.

Hence Archimedes’ Principle does not hold good.', 'Question 4.\nA block of wood floats in a pan of water in an elevator. When the elevator starts from rest and accelerates downward, does the 1 block floats higher above the water surface? What happens when the elevator accelerates upward? *\n': 'wer:\nWhen the elevator accelerates downward, the weight of the block of wood decreases. Hence it will float higher above the water’s surface.', 'Question 5.\nThe thrust on a human being due to atmospheric pressure is about 15 tons. How human being can withstand such an enormous thrust while it is impossible for him to carry a load of even one ton?\n': 'wer:\nThere is a large number of pores and openings on the skin of a body. Through these openings, air goes within the system and there is free communication between the inside and the outside. The presence of; the air inside the body counterbalances the pressure outside.', 'Question 6.\nWhy are sleepers used below the rails? Explain.\n': 'wer:\nWhen sleepers are placed below the rails, the area of the cross- p section is increased. We know that P = F/A, so when the train runs on the rails, the pressure exerted on the ground due to the weight of the train is small because of a large area of cross-section of the sleeper. Hence the ground will not yield under the weight of the train.', 'Question 7.\nThe passengers are advised to remove the ink from their f pens while going up in an airplane. Explain why?\n': 'wer:\nWith the increase in height, the atmospheric pressure decreases. The ink in the pen is filled at the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the earth. So as the plane rises up, the pressure decreases \\ and the ink will flow out of the pen from higher pressure to the low ‘pressure region. This will spoil the clothes of passengers.', 'Question 8.\nWhy a sinking ship often turns over as it becomes immersed in water?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the ship is floating, the metacenter of the ship is above the center of gravity. While sinking the ship takes in water and as a result, the center of gravity is raised above the metacenter. The ship turns over due to the couple formed by the weight and the buoyant force.', 'Question 9.\nExplain why a balloon filled with helium does not rise in the air indefinitely but halts after a certain height?\n': 'wer:\nThe balloon initially rises in the air because the weight of the displaced air i.e> upthrust is greater than the weight of the helium and the balloon. Since the density of air decreases with height, therefore, the balloon halts at a particular height where the density of air is such that the weight of air displaced is just equal to the weight of helium gas and the balloon. Hence the net force acting on the balloon is zero and the balloon stops rising.', 'Question 10.\nA light ball can remain suspended in a vertical jet of water flow?\n': 'wer:\nThe region where the ball and the vertical jet of water are in contact is a region of low pressure because of higher velocity. The pressure on the other side of the ball is larger. Due, to the pressure difference, the ball remains suspended.', 'Question 11.\nIn the case of an emergency, a vacuum brake is used to stop the train. How does this brake work?\n': 'wer:\nSteam at high pressure is made to enter the cylinder of the vacuum brake. Due to high velocity, pressure decreases in accordance with Bernoulli’s principle. Due to this decrease in pressure, the piston gets lifted. Hence the brake gets lifted.', 'Question 12.\nWhy dust generally settles down in a closed room?\n': 'wer:\nDust particles may be regarded as tiny spheres. They acquire terminal velocity after having fallen through some distance in the air. Since the terminal velocity varies directly as the square of the radius therefore the terminal velocity of dust particles is very small. So they settle down gradually.', 'Question 13.\nHow will the rise of a liquid be affected if the top of the capillary tube is closed?\n': 'wer:\nThe air trapped between the meniscus of the liquid and the closed end of the tube will be compressed. The compressed air shall oppose the rise of liquid in the tube.', 'Question 14.\nWhat are buoyancy and the center of buoyancy?\n': 'wer:', 'Question 15.\nUnder what conditions:\n(a) Centre of buoyancy coincides with the center of gravity?\n': 'wer:\nFor a solid body of uniform density, the center of gravity coincides with the center of buoyancy.', 'Question 16.\nWhy small pieces of camphor dance about on the surface of the water?\n': 'wer:\nWhen the camphor is dissolved in water, the surface tension of water is reduced. Since camphor has an irregular shape therefore it may dissolve more at one end than at the other end. This produces an unbalanced force due to which it moves. When it reaches a different region, the same process is repeated.', 'Question 17.\nOn what factors does the critical velocity of the liquid depend?\n': 'wer:\nCritical velocity (vc) of a liquid is:', 'Question 18.\nWhat are the two forces which determine the shape of a liquid drop?\n': 'wer:\nThe shape of a liquid drop is determined by the interplay of two forces – gravitational force and the force of surface tension. The gravitational force tries to flatten the drop so that the center of gravity comes at the lowest point.', 'Question 19.\nA drop of oil placed on the surface of water spreads out. But a drop of water placed on oil contracts to a spherical shape. Explain both the phenomenon\n': 'wer:\nA drop of oil placed on the surface of water spreads because the force of adhesion between water molecules and oil molecules dominates the cohesive force-of oil molecules. So oil drop on water spreads.', 'Question 20.\nWhy are the droplets of mercury when brought in contact pulled together to form a bigger drop? Also, a state with reasons whether the temperature of this bigger drop will be the same or more or less than the temperature of the smaller drop.\n': 'wer:\nIt is due to large cohesive forces acting between the molecules of mercury that the droplets of mercury when brought in contact pulled together to form a bigger drop.', 'Question 21.\nOil spreads over the surface of the water. Why?\n': 'wer:\nThe surface tension of oil is smaller than that of water. When oil is dropped on the surface of the water, the force stretches the oil drops on all sides. Hence the oil spreads over the surface of the water.', 'Question 22.\nWhy is it easier to skate on ice than on a smooth aluminum sheet?\n': 'wer:\nThe ice below the feet of the person smelts on account of increased pressure. Tiny drops of water are formed. These behave like ‘rollers’ and thus it is easier to skate on ice. No such thing is possible in the case of aluminum sheets.', 'Question 23.\nWhat are the factors on which angle of contact depends?\n': 'wer:\nIt depends upon the following factors:', 'Question 24.\nProve Archimedes’ Principle mathematically.\n': 'wer:\nLet W1 and W2 be the weights of the body in the air and when completely immersed in a liquid respectively.\n\n∴ Loss in weight of body inside the liquid = W1 – W2.\n \n\x0c\nhttps://www.learninsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Class-11-Physics-Important-Questions-Chapter-10-Mechanical-Properties-of-Fluids-3.png', 'Question 25.\nDerive the condition of floatation of the body.\n': 'wer:\nWhen a body floats in a liquid with a part submerged in the liquid, the weight of the liquid displaced by the submerged part is always equal to the weight of the body.', 'Question 26.\n(a) Why the wings of an airplane are rounded outwards (i.e. more curved) while flattened inwards? What is this shape called?\n': 'wer:\nThe special design of the wings which is slightly convex upward and concave downward increases velocity at the upper surface and decreases it at the lower surface. So according to Bernoulli’s Theorem, the pressure on the upper side is less than the pressure on the lower side.', 'Question 27.\nWhat is a hydrostatic paradox? Explain. Is it really a paradox?\n': 'wer:\nIt is defined as the inability of a liquid to flow from a vessel having more liquid to a vessel having lesser liquid when the liquid level is the same. Consider three vessels of different shapes but the same base area as shown., The level of water is kept the same in A, B, and C. So the quantity of water is different in the vessels. However, the thrust on the bottom is the same in all of them. It may appear paradoxical', 'Question 28.\nState Pascal’s law. How does it get changed in the presence of gravity?\n': 'wer:\nPascal’s law states that for a liquid in equilibrium, the pressure is the same everywhere (provided the effect of gravity can be neglected), It may also be stated as “the pressure applied anywhere on an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid”.\n\nEffect of gravity: Consider a liquid of density p contained in a vessel.

Why?\n': 'wer:\nWhen a liquid is heated, it becomes rarer due to a decrease in density and it rises up. Liquid from the upper part of the vessel comes down to take its place and thus convection currents are formed. If the liquid is heated at the top, no such convection currents will be formed and only the liquid in the upper part of the vessel will become hot. However, the temperature in the lower part of the vessel will rise slightly due to a small amount of heat conducted by the hot liquid in the upper part of the vessel.', 'Question 10.\nIf a drop of waterfalls on a very hot iron, it does not evaporate fora long time. Why?\n': 'wer:\nWhen a drop of waterfalls on a very hot iron, it gets insulated from the hot iron due to the formation of a thin layer of water vapour, which is a bad conductor in nature.

After some time, it is found that the inside of the car is considerably warmer than the air outside. Explain why?\n': 'wer:\nGlass possesses the property of selective absorption of heat radiation. It also transmits about 50% of heat radiation coming from a hot source like the sun and is more or less opaque to the radiation from moderately hot bodies (at about 100°C or so). Due to this, when a car is left in the sun, heat radiation from the sun gets into the car but as the temperature inside the car is moderate, it cannot escape through its windows. Thus glass windows of the car trap the sun rays and because of this, the inside of the car becomes considerably warmer.', 'Question 12.\nIt takes longer to boil water with a flame in a satellite in gravitational field-free space, why? How it will be heated?\n': 'wer:\nWater boils with flame by the process of convection. Hot lighter particles raise up and heavier particles move down under gravity.

The space between the walls is evacuated in a good hot case. The food container placed inside the hot case is made of crowning steel, thus neither the outside low-temperature air can enter the container nor the heat from inside can escape through the hot case by conduction or convection. The highly polished shining surface of the food container helps in stopping loss of heat due to radiation. Thus, the heat of the food is preserved for a long time and food remains hot in winter.', 'Question 15.\nYou might have seen beggars sleeping on footpaths or in open in winter with their hands and knees pulled inside. Similarly dogs too curl while sleeping in winter. How does such action help anybody?\n': 'wer:\nThe heat radiated or emitted from a body at a given temperature depends on', 'Question 16.\nMany people enjoy bathing below Kempty fall in Mussoorie, even though the water is quite cold, explain?\n': 'wer:\nWhen water falls from a height, it loses its potential energy. This is converted into the kinetic energy of the water molecules. It is a known fact from the kinetic theory of gases that an increase in kinetic energy of the substance increases its temperature, hence the temperature of water at the bottom of the fall rises and it does not remain as cold as on the top. Therefore, people taking bath below the Kempty fall do not get frozen, they rather feel warm and enjoy bathing.', 'Question 17.\nCycle, scooter handles and steering wheels of four-wheelers have plastic, rubber or cotton thread coverings. Why?\n': 'wer:\nCycle and scooter handle, as well as steering wheels of four-wheelers such as car, truck, tempo, are made of metals which are good conductors of heat. In winter when we hold them the body heat is conducted to them being at lower temperature and in summer their temperature is more than the body temperature, transfer heat to the human hands. In either case, the human being feels uncomfortable.', 'Question 18.\nWhy metals like copper, iron, brass etc. are good conductors of heat whereas wood, cardboard, ply are not conductors of heat?\n': 'wer:\nHeat conductibility in solids apart from temperature depends on the availability of conducting particles i.e. free electrons. In metals like copper, brass and iron-free electrons are available but in insulators like wood, cardboard and ply free electrons are not available, so metal is good conductors of heat.', 'Question 19.\nHouse in Rajasthan made of stone and lime are cooler than those made of brick and cement why?\n': 'wer:\nThe thermal conductivity of lime is smaller than that of cement. Even though stone tends to be Rotter than a brick in the day time as much as. does the cement plaster. Similarly, on cold days or cold nights even during summer, the heat of the house is not allowed to escape out. The thickness of stone walls compared to brick walls is yet another factor in keeping the houses, cool or warm in opposite”conditions.', 'Question 20.\nHousing on hills are either made of wood or have wooden lining and walls. Why? Why people in plains where temperature variations are extreme winter and summer do not use-wooden house?\n': 'wer:\nOn hills, people make wooden houses or put wooden lining, on house walls to insulate the house from the extreme cold of winter because wood being a bad conductor of heat does not allow the heat of house to escape out or exchange low outside temperature with the high temperature inside.', 'Question 21.\nPeople who own cars know well if they close all glass windows of the car park it in the Sun, it remains very hot inside the car even after sunset. To keep inside the car cooler insulating screens are put inside the car covering, the winds screen and curtains are pulled on the glass of windows, explain.\n': 'wer:\nGlass at normal temperature say up to 100° is opaque to heat radiations. But if radiations are coming from a source having a high temperature (surface temperature of sun ~ 6000k), it becomes transparent. Thus heat from the sun enters the car but radiations from the car being at a lower temperature (~ 50°C) cannot escape out so it remains hot, glass is opaque for radiations at such low temperature and the car body is double-walled or lined with insulators also does not allow the inner body heat to escape, Thus inside of the car remains hot.', 'Question 22.\nWhat are the various properties of a thermometric substance?\n': 'wer:\nFollowing are the properties of a thermometric substance:', 'Question 23.\nIt is generally very cold after the hail storm than during or before it. Why?\n': 'wer:\nAfter a hail storm, the ice balls melt by absorbing a lot of heat energy from the atmosphere, thus reducing its temperature. Hence there is very cold after the hail storm.', 'Question 24.\nWhy pendulums made of invar are used in clocks?\n': 'wer:\nInvar has a low value of the coefficient of linear expansion, so the length of the pendulum almost remains the same in different seasons and hence gives the correct time.', 'Question 25.\nShould a thermometer bulb have a large heat capacity or a small heat capacity? Why?\n': 'wer:\nA thermometer bulb should have a small heat capacity. In case, if it has a large capacity, the temperature of the substance will get lowered due to a large amount of heat absorbed by the thermometer bulb.', 'Question 26.\nExplain why the coefficient of cubical expansion of water is negative between 0°C and 4°C?\n': 'wer:\nThis is because of the fact that the volume of water decreases between 0°C and 4°C and water contracts within this range of temperature.', 'Question 27.\nWhy good conductors of electricity are also good conductors of heat?\n': 'wer:\nBoth thermal and electrical conductivity depends upon the number of free electrons which are in large number in good conductors of electricity.', 'Question 28.\nHow is a gas thermometer better than a mercury thermometer?\n': 'wer:\nA gas thermometer is better because it can measure very low and very high temperature while the range of mercury thermometer is limited due to its freezing point – 37°C and boiling point 357°C.', 'Question 29.\nA vertical glass jar is filled with water at 10°C. It has one thermometer at the top and another at the bottom. The central region of the jar is gradually cooled. It is found that the bottom thermometer reads 4°C earlier than the top thermometer and the top thermometer reads 0°C earlier than the bottom thermometer. Why?\n': 'wer:\nThis is because water expands on cooling from 4°C to 0°C, thus it becomes of highest density at 4°C and then its density goes down. So the bottom thermometer reads 4°C earlier as the temperature of water at the top will be more than 4°C.', 'Question 30.\nTwo spheres are m&amp;de of the same metal and have the same mass.

Why?\n': 'wer:\nEarth’s atmosphere is warmer as compared to the surface of the earth at night. The temperature increases with altitude and thus the velocity of sound increases. It is a case of reflection from denser to rarer medium.', 'Question 7.\nWater is being continuously poured into a vessel. Can you estimate the height of the water level reached in the vessel simply by listening to the sound produced?\n': 'wer:\nYes, the frequency of the sound produced by an air column is inversely proportional to the length of the air column. As the level of water in the vessel rises, the length of the air column in the vessel decreases, so the frequency of sound increases, and hence shrillness of sound increases.', 'Question 8.\nA sonometer wire resonates with a tuning fork. If the length of the wire between the bridges is made twice even then it can resonate with the same fork.

Explain.\n': 'wer:\nSound waves require a material medium for their propagation.', 'Question 10.\nWhat is redshift?\n': 'wer:\nIt is due to Doppler’s effect in the case of light waves. It is known that all stars are moving away from each other. So apparent frequency of light from a star as received by an observer on earth is less than the actual frequency. Since wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, the apparent wavelength of light from stars is more than the actual wavelength.', 'Question 11.\nA sitar wife and a tabla when sounded together give 4 beats/ sec.

So the sound waves are mostly reflected from the surface of the water. Only little refraction of sound from air to water takes place. Moreover, the refracted sound waves die off after traveling a small distance in the water. Hence no sound waves reach deep inside the water.', 'Question 18.\nThe reverberation time is larger for an empty hall than a crowded hall. Explain why?\n': 'wer:\nThe sound prolongs for a longer time in an empty hall as it does not get absorbed. In the case of a crowded hall, the sound is absorbed by the audience. Hence reverberation time is less in the crowded hall.', 'Question 19.\nIf a balloon is filled with C02 gas, then how will it behave for sound as a lens? On filling it with hydrogen gas, what will happen?\n': 'wer:\nThe speed of sound in CO2 is less than in air (∴ v ∝ \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\)). So the balloon filled with CO2 gas behaves as a concave lens.', 'Question 20.\nWhy on reflection from the rigid surface, the wave does not change type, and only phase change occurs, while on reflection from a smooth surface, type changes while phase does not change?\n': 'wer:\nWhen a compression strikes the rigid surface, the surface does not move but pushes the compression back as such. On the other hand, the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium is reversed. Thus the type of wave does not change while phase change occurs.', 'Question 21.\nExplain why transverse elastic waves can’t propagate through a fluid?\n': 'wer:\nWhen a transverse elastic wave travels through a solid, a shearing strain develops which is supported by the elastic solid because of the development of a restoring force.

However, benzene does not respond to nucleophilic substitution because nucleophile prefers to attack a centre of low electron density.\nRole of catalyst in Electrophilic Substitution Reactions.\nIn the monosubstitution reactions of benzene discussed earlier in the properties of arenes, we have seen that a catalyst is always present which may be either a Lewis acid (Ferric salt or Anhydrous aluminium chloride) or a proton acid (sulphuric acid).', 'Question 20.\nHow will you convert following into benzene ?\n(i) Ethyne\n(ii) Ethene\n(iii) Hexane\n': 'wer:\n\n(i) Ethyne to benzene\nfo CHT\n\nA\n\\, Red-hot Cu-tube a GF\na\nBCHECH ~poymerisaion” HC CH\n‘ ScH~\nEthyne Benzene\n\n(ii) Ethene to benzene\n\nBn KOH (alc.)\nCH,=CH, —> H2-Ch ——> cach =, OC\n\nBr OBr\nEthene _1,2-Dibromoethane Ethyne Benzene\n(iii) Hexane to benzene\n7 Cis\n\n‘ ai (Hs _cao7iva05 M0203 C1207 /V205 /Mo203 pALeeeee\n4 CCH) raxii0 w 20 am lia)” pie Game oe ioe\n‘CH,\n\n.
