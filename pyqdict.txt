The learner shooter might have not held it tightly against his shoulder and hence the gun must have injured his shoulder after firing.', 'Question 2.\n(a) Newton’s first law of motion is the law of Inertia. Explain.\n': '\nAccording to Newton’s first law of motion, a body can’t change its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless an external force acts on it. It means that the natural tendency of the material body is to continue in the state of rest or that of uniform motion which is termed as inertia. Thus Newton’s first law is the law of inertia.', 'Question 3.\n(a) An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter-steller space at a constant rate of 100 ms-2. What is the acceleration of the astronaut at the instant after he is outside the spaceship?\n': '\nAccording to Newton’s first law of motion, the moment he is out of the spaceship, there is no external force on the astronaut, thus his acceleration is zero.

One boy is much heavier than the other. The lightweight boy pulls on the rope. How will they move?\n': '\nThe light-weight boy is doing the action on the heavy boy by pulling the rope. According to Newton’s third law, equal and opposite force (reaction) also acts on the light boy. As the mass of the boy pulling the rope is lesser, so the acceleration produced in him will be more. Thus both the boys move tow; rds each other and the lighter boy will move faster.', 'Question 6.\nExplain why ball bearings are used in machinery?\n': '\nWe know that rolling friction is much lesser than sliding friction, so we convert the sliding friction into rolling friction which is done using ball bearings that are placed in between the axle and the hub of the wheel. The ball bearings tend to roll around the axle as the wheel turns and as such the frictional force is reduced.', 'Question 7.\nWhy a horse has to apply more force to start a cart than to keep it moving? Explain.\n': '\nStatic friction comes into play when the horse applies force to start the motion in the cart. On the other hand, kinetic friction comes into play when the cart is moving.', 'Question 8.\nSand is thrown on tracks or roads covered with snow. Explain why?\n': '\nWhen the roads (or tracks) are covered with snow, then there is a considerable reduction of frictional force between the tires of the vehicles and the road (or between the track and the wheels of the vehicle or train) which leads to the skidding of the vehicles (or trains). Thus, driving is not safe. When sand is thrown on the snow-covered roads (or tracks), then the force of friction increases, so safe driving is possible.', 'Question 9.\nExplain why is it difficult to move a cycle along a road with its brakes on?\n': '\nWhen we move the cycle with its brakes on, then its wheels can only skid i.e. slide along the road as they can’t rotate. So the friction is sliding in nature. As the sliding friction is greater than fr,e rolling friction, therefore, it is difficult to move a cycle with its brakes on.', 'Question 10.\nExplain how proper inflation of tires saves fuel?\n': '\nWhen the tires are properly inflated, the area of contact between the tires and the ground is reduced which in turn reduces the rolling friction. As a result of this, there is less dissipation of energy against friction. So the cover of the automobile/eater distance for the same quantity of fuel consumed. Hence proper inflation of tires leads to saving fuel.', 'Question 11.\nExplain how the man at rest in the middle of a pond of perfectly frictionless ice comes out by blowing air or splitting etc.?\n': '\nBy blowing air from b’s mouth in a forwarding direction, the man applies some force in that direction and hence imparts some momentum to the air blown out from his mouth. According to the law of conservation of linear momentum, an equal and opposite momentum will be imparted to his body. Since there is no force of friction and hence no energy is wasted. Finally, by doing the same action again and again he gets himself on the shore.', 'Question 12.\nGive one argument in favor of the fact that frictional force is a non-conservative force.\n': '\nThe direction of the frictional force is opposite to the direction of motion. When a body is moved, say from point A to B and then back to A, then work is required to be done both during forward and backward motion. So the network done in a round trip is not zero. Hence the frictional force is a non-conservative force.', 'Question 13.\nWhy is it more dangerous to fall on frozen ice than on fresh snow?\n': '\nThe fresh snow is softer and frozen ice is harder. So the impulse caused by falling on fresh snow is much lesser than frozen snow. Thus, falling on frozen ice may cause serious injury or maybe fatal (the reaction will be much greater in this case).', 'Question 14.\n(a) An astronaut in open space is away from his spaceship. How can he return to his ship?\n': '\nUsing Newton’s third law of motion, he can reach his spaceship. He must throw objects with appropriate force opposite to the direction of the spaceship. The recoil will send him-to his spaceship.', 'Question 15.\nWhat is the difference between absolute and gravitational units of force?\n': '\nThe absolute units of force don’t depend upon the value of acceleration due to gravity, so they remain the same throughout the universe. But the gravitational units of force depend upon the value of ‘g’ which is different at different places.', 'Question 16.\nA disc of mass m is placed on a table. A stiff spring is attached to it and is vertical. To the other end of the spring is attached a disc of negligible mass. What minimum force should be applied to the upper disc to press the spring such that the lower disc is lifted off the table when the external force is suddenly removed?\n': '\nThe minimum force should be mg. When a force mg is applied vertically downwards on the upper disc, the lower disc will be pressed against the floor with a force mg. The floor will exert an upward reaction mg. When the external force is suddenly removed, this reaction will just lift the lower disc.', 'Question 17.\nA force acting on a material particle of mass m first grows to a maximum value Fm and then decreases to zero. The force varies with time according to a linear law, and the total time of motion is tm.

Why? Given an example.\n': '\nSometimes friction between two surfaces decreases to such an extent that it is difficult to move on that surface. So friction needs to be increased. For example, vehicles can’t move on a road covered with snow. In such cases, we have to throw sand on the road to increase the friction.', 'Question 19.\nVehicles stop applying brakes. Does this phenomenon violate the principle of conservation of momentum?\n': '\nThe law of conservation of momentum is not violated by stopping vehicles from applying brakes. Some retarding force is being applied due to brakes and the vehicle comes to rest such that the total loss of its momentum is equal to the impulse of the applied force. Thus the law of conservation of momentum is not violated.', 'Question 20.\n“Two surfaces if made extremely smooth, will have a very low value of friction between them.” Is the statement true? Justify your answer with two illustrations.\n': '\nThe given statement is wrong. This is because the force of frictions increased when the surfaces in contact are made highly smooth.', 'Question 21.\nWhy force of friction increases when the two surfaces in contact are made extremely smooth i.e. polished beyond a certain limit?\n': '\nWhen the two surfaces in contact are made extremely smooth, then they come in intimate contact with each other. So the force of adhesion comes into play- Due to this force, the motion of one surface over the other surface becomes retarding and hence causes an increase in the friction.', 'Question 22.\n(a) A small amount of water spread on a marble floor causes slipping. Why?\n': '\nWater fills the grooves in the floor and makes it more smooth thus reducing friction and it causes slipping.', 'Question 23.\nA body moving over the surface of another body suddenly comes to rest. What happens to friction between the two surfaces?\n': '\nThe force of friction will be present only so long as there is relative motion between the two bodies and it automatically disappears as soon as the relative motion ceases.', 'Question 24.\nExplain why one should take short steps rather than long steps while walking on ice?\n': '\nThere is a danger of slipping if one walks on ice by taking long steps.

He has to apply retarding force to stop the moving ball in his hands. If he catches the ball abruptly, then he has to apply a large retarding force for a short time. So he gets hurt.', 'Question 26.\nWhy are buffers provided between the bogies of a railway train?\n': '\nBuffers are provided between the bogies of a train to reduce shocks or jerks by reducing the impulse or impact of a force. Springs of buffers increase the time of contact in the collision of bogies and thus the force acting on the bogies will be small and hence the passengers sitting inside the train will feel fewer jerks.', 'Question 27.\nIt is more difficult to catch a cricket ball than to catch a tennis ball moving with the same velocity. Explain why?\n': '\nThe mass of a cricket ball is greater than the mass of a tennis ball, so the change in momentum of the cricket ball is more than that of the tennis ball. Hence greater force is required to catch the cricket ball than that of the tennis ball.', 'Question 28.\n(a) A body of mass 25 g is moving with a constant velocity of 5 ms’1 on a horizontal frictionless surface in a vacuum, what is the force acting on the body?\n': '\nF = ma, where a = acceleration of the body.\nFor constant velocity, a = 0, so F = 0.\nThus when a body moves with constant velocity then no force acts on it.', 'Question 29.\nA woman stands on a spring scale on an elevator.

The air friction depends on the volume of the body or the air displaced. So the height attained by the body in projectile motion is severely restricted by the air friction. The height reached is reduced compared to one which is attained in the absence of air.', 'Question 32.\nWhy is it difficult to climb a greasy pole or rope?\n': '\nFor climbing any pole or rope, the climber presses the pole or rope with his feet which in turn pushes the feet and the person climbs up.

Due to this, the force of reaction on the man is reduced to a great extent. Because the increase in time reduces the impulse which is equal to the changes in momentum (FΔt = m Δv). So, F is quite less and the man is not injured by the net. In fact, F pushes him up once and again he falls on the net.', 'Question 36.\n(a) A meteorite burns in the atmosphere before it reaches the Earth’s surface.

Why?\n': '\nThe box should be pushed by a force parallel to the plane. This will neither increase the reaction nor the force of friction. If the force is applied horizontally, only a component of the force will push the box up but the second component acting normally to the inclined plane will increase the reaction of the plane and thereby increase the force of friction. This will make the pushing of the box up the inclined harder.', 'Question 38.\nExplain the role of friction in the case of bicycle brakes.

Heating of solids, in general, bring about a change in state, and during this process, some loss of mass occurs due to evaporation.', 'Question 21.\nA football kicked by a player leaves the ground and after traveling in the air reaches the ground and comes to stop at some other position on the ground. Identify the energy transformation in this process. Is the energy of the ball conserved?\n': '\nThe kinetic energy imparted to the ball is converted into potential energy at the highest point and a small part remains kinetic.

Hence hydrogen escapes faster from the Earth than oxygen.', 'Question 5.\nIn a spaceship moving in a gravity-free region, the astronaut will not be able to distinguish between up and down. Explain why?\n': '\nThe upward and downward sense is due to the gravitational force of attraction between the body and the earth. In a spaceship, the gravitational force is counterbalanced by the centripetal force needed by the satellite to move around the Earth in a circular orbit. Hence in the absence of zero force, the astronaut will not be able to distinguish between up and down.', 'Question 6.\nWhy the space rockets are generally launched from west to east?\n': '\nSince the Earth revolves from west to east around the Sun, so when the rocket is launched from west to east, the relative velocity of the rocket = launching velocity of rocket + linear velocity of Earth.

Explain why.\n': '\nAccording to Newton’s law of gravitation, every particle of this universe attracts every other particle with a force that is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. When we move our fingers, the distance between the particles changes, and hence the force of attraction changes which in turn disturbs the whole universe.', 'Question 9.\nExplain why tennis ball bounces higher on hills than on plains.\n': '\nThe value of acceleration due to gravity is lesser on hills than on the plains, so the weight of the tennis ball at hills is lesser than that on the plains and hence it re-bounces more. In other words, the force with which the Earth attracts the ball on hills will be lesser than that on the plains.', 'Question 10.\nWhy is the atmosphere comparatively rarer on some of the planets as compared to that on earth?\n': '\nThe escape velocity of some of the planets is very small as compared to that on the surface of Earth. Most of these gases have their root mean square (r.m.s.) velocities more than the escape velocity on these planets and hence they have escaped from the surface of these planets and hence the atmosphere is rarer on some of the planets than on Earth.', 'Question 11.\nWhy moon has no atmosphere? Explain.\n': '\nAn atmosphere means the presence of a mixture of a number of gases. The molecules of these gases are in the state of continuous random motion moving with different velocities.

So the springs of such balances will take time to recover their original configuration. Hence the readings shown by such spring balances will be wrong.', 'Question 8.\nElasticity is said to be the internal property of matter. Explain.\n': '\nWhen a deforming force acts on a body, the atoms of the substances get displaced from their original positions. Due to this the configuration of the matter (substance) changes.

On comparing chloride ion with fluoride ion we find that electron density per unit volume in fluoride ion (F–) is more than in chloride (Cl–) ion.
