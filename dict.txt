Measure the length of this coil, mode by the thread, with a metre scale. If n be the number of turns of the coil and l be the length of the coil, then the length occupied by each single turn i.e., the thickness of the thread = 1/n .\nThis is equal to the diameter of the thread.\n(b) We know that least count = Pitch/number of divisions on circular scale When number of divisions on circular scale is increased, least count is decreased. Hence the accuracy is increased. However, this is only a theoretical idea.Practically speaking, increasing the number of ‘turns would create many difficulties.\nAs an example, the low resolution of the human eye would make observations difficult. The nearest divisions would not clearly be distinguished as separate. Moreover, it would be technically difficult to maintain uniformity of the pitch of the screw throughout its length.\n(c) Due to random errors, a large number of observation will give a more reliable result than smaller number of observations. This is due to the fact that the probability (chance) of making a positive random error of a given magnitude is equal to that of making a negative random error of the same magnitude. Thus in a large number of observations, positive and negative errors are likely to cancel each other. Hence more reliable result can be obtained.', 'Question 2. 9.
